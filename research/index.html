			<h1>Research</h1>
			My research interests include <i><u>formal methods</u></i> and their application on <i><u>software
					verification</u></i>, as well as the development of <i><u>logical foundations</u></i> for
			<i><u>programming languages</u></i>. I have always been interested in pure mathematical reasoning and I
			found in these fields of Computer Science a way to nurture that interest while contributing with a direct
			impact in society. Threading on the boundary between theory and practice is something I wish to explore at
			this early stage of my career.
			<br><br>

			Currently, I am working on <i><u>incorrectness logic</u></i> for scalable bug detection in libraries that
			rely on internal use of <i><u>unsafe features</u></i>. In particular, my focus is on the <a
				href="https://www.rust-lang.org" target="_blank">Rust</a> programming language, building on the type
			soundness result of <a href="https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/popl18" target="_blank"> RustBelt</a>. The
			main goal of this project is to develop a sound and scalable technique for <i><u>automatic</u></i> detection
			of <i><u>type unsoundness</u></i> in internally unsafe Rust libraries.
			<br><br>

			I have experience with the <a href="https://rocq-prover.org" target="_blank">Rocq</a> proof assistant and
			with the <a href="https://iris-project.org" target="_blank">Iris</a> framework. My <a
				href="/research/carrott2022thesis">MSc thesis</a> consisted in the verification of a concurrent skip
			list algorithm in Iris. The <a href="https://github.com/sr-lab/iris-jellyfish" target="_blank">Rocq
				development</a> is publicly available and also contains an alternative definition of atomic triples
			within the Iris logic.
			<br><br>

			<nuno-saavedra></nuno-saavedra> and I created <a href="/research/carrott2024coqpyt">CoqPyt</a>, a Python
			tool for interacting with Rocq (previously known as Coq) via extraction of contextual information from
			proofs, as well as insertion and removal of steps in proofs. CoqPyt allowed the construction of a dataset
			used to train and evaluate <a href="/research/thompson2025rango">Rango</a>, a state-of-the-art LLM-based
			proof synthesizer.
